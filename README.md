# Supervised Learning Approach to Solving Inverse Kinematics
Our final project for EE 375 at Northwestern University was to solve the inverse kinematics problem for a planar 3 joint manipulator. Our project was based on the paper 
"Neural network based inverse kinematics solution for trajectory tracking of a robotic arm" published by Adrian-Vasile Duka.
